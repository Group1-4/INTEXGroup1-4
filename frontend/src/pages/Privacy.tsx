          <ul>
            <li>We, our Service Providers, CineNiche Marketing Providers, and Advertising Companies use cookies, other similar technologies (such as pixel tags), and resettable device identifiers for various reasons. This section explains the types of technologies used, what they do, and your corresponding choices. To choose whether or not to receive cookies and similar technologies, please see the section below "How can I exercise choice regarding these technologies?"</li>
            <li>Cookies are small data files that are commonly stored on your device when you access websites and online services. The text in a cookie contains a string of numbers and letters that may uniquely identify a device and can contain other information as well. This allows the web server to recognize your browser each time it connects to that web server.</li>
            <li>We use other technologies such as browser storage and plugins (for example, HTML5, IndexedDB, and WebSQL). Like cookies, these other technologies may store small amounts of data on a device. Pixel tags often work in conjunction with cookies. In many cases, declining cookies will impair the effectiveness of pixel tags associated with those cookies.</li>

        <Section id="cookie-types" title="What types of cookies do we use?">
        <ul>
            <li>If you use a CineNiche app (such as the main CineNiche app, or a CineNiche game app) on a mobile device, tablet, or streaming media device, we may collect a resettable device identifier from your device. Resettable device identifiers can be used like cookies and are found on many mobile devices and tablets (for example, the "Identifier for Advertisers" on Apple iOS devices and the "Google Advertising ID" on Android devices), and certain streaming media devices. Like cookies, resettable device identifiers are used to make online advertising more relevant, and for analytics and optimization purposes.</li>
            <li>We use these types of technologies for various reasons, including to provide our service (for example, by making it easy to access our service by remembering you when you return); to administer and operate our business, to research, analyze and improve our services (for example, to improve site performance, monitor visitor traffic and actions on our site, and to test the effectiveness of our user interface); to send marketing and informational messages (for example, to deliver and tailor our marketing, and to understand interactions with our emails, marketing, and marketing on third party services); to operate our ad supported subscription plan; for safety, security and fraud prevention; and to comply with law and enforce our Terms of Use. These technologies enable CineNiche Marketing Providers to collect personal information (such as the pages you visit and device and network information) when you use our services, and CineNiche Marketing Providers may also collect information about your online activities over time across different websites.</li>
            <li>We use pixel tags in our emails to understand how members interact with our services. Our use of pixel tags helps us understand when links within messages are clicked, or the emails are opened.</li>

            <li>To exercise choice regarding CineNiche's use of resettable device identifiers (for marketing the CineNiche service or CineNiche content, or as used in connection with an ad supported subscription plan), please configure the appropriate setting on your device (usually found under "privacy" or "ads" in your device settings). If you choose not to allow this, you may still see marketing messages promoting CineNiche (and Advertisements if you subscribe to an ad supported subscription plan) on that device but it will not be selected based on the use of a resettable device identifier.
